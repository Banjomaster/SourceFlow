Okay, let's break this down. The user wants an AI-powered tool that can analyze any codebase, regardless of the programming language, and generate a detailed diagram showing the code's structure, dependencies, and execution paths. This tool should be able to understand the code's functionality, inputs, outputs, and overall purpose.
First, I need to think about how to approach this. Since the tool needs to work with any programming language, I can't rely on language-specific parsers or tools. That means I need a more general approach, probably using AI to understand the code.
I could use a large language model (LLM) to analyze the code. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of code and can understand the structure and functionality of code in various languages. I could feed the code to the LLM and ask it to extract the necessary information.
But how do I structure this? I need to recursively go through the directory, analyze each file, and build a graph of the code's structure. That sounds like a job for a graph database or a tool like Graphviz.
Wait, actually, in the previous message, the user mentioned using Graphviz to visualize the graph. So, I can use Graphviz to create the diagram.
Now, let's think about the AI part. I need the AI to understand the code and extract information like functions, classes, inputs, outputs, dependencies, and execution paths.
One way to do this is to have the AI analyze each file and generate a summary of its contents. For example, for each function, the AI could provide a description, list its inputs and outputs, and identify any other functions it calls.
Then, I can use this information to build a graph where nodes represent functions or classes, and edges represent calls or dependencies.
But how do I handle different programming languages? Well, since the LLM is trained on multiple languages, it should be able to understand code in various languages. I might need to provide some context or specify the language when prompting the LLM.
Also, I need to handle large codebases. Analyzing each file individually might be time-consuming, but I can parallelize the process or use batching to make it more efficient.
Let me outline the steps:
Traverse the directory recursively to find all code files.

For each code file, determine its programming language based on the file extension.

Feed the code to the LLM along with a prompt asking for a summary of the code, including functions, classes, inputs, outputs, and dependencies.

Parse the LLM's response to extract the relevant information.

Use this information to build a graph, where nodes are functions or classes, and edges are calls or dependencies.

Generate a diagram using Graphviz or a similar tool.

Wait, but the user wants a detailed block diagram or workflow diagram. So, perhaps a flowchart showing the execution paths would be more appropriate.
To create a flowchart, I need to understand the control flow of the code, which might be more challenging. The LLM might not be able to provide a complete control flow graph, but it could identify the main execution paths.
Alternatively, I could focus on a higher-level diagram showing the relationships between different components of the code.
Let me think about what the user really needs. They want to understand complex code paths and jump directly to areas for fixes or enhancements. So, probably a diagram showing how different parts of the code interact would be helpful.
For example, a call graph showing which functions call which other functions.
That seems feasible. The LLM can identify function definitions and calls within the code.
But I also need to handle dependencies between files or modules. For instance, if one file imports another, there might be dependencies there.
So, perhaps I need to analyze the import statements or include directives to understand inter-file dependencies.
Wait, but since the LLM can understand the code, maybe it can identify these dependencies as well.
Let me try to formulate a prompt for the LLM.
For a given code file, I could ask something like:
"Analyze the following [language] code and provide:
A list of functions or classes defined in this file, along with a brief description of what each does.

For each function or class, list its inputs (parameters) and outputs (return values).

Identify any other functions or classes that are called or used within this file.

List any external dependencies, such as imported modules or included headers.

Please format the response as follows:
FUNCTIONS:
function_name: description
Inputs: [list of inputs]
Outputs: [list of outputs]
Calls: [list of called functions]
...
DEPENDENCIES:
[list of imported modules or included headers]
"
Then, I can parse this response to extract the information.
Similarly, for other languages, the prompt might need to be adjusted slightly, but the general structure can be the same.
Wait, actually, since the LLM is language-agnostic, I can use a similar prompt for different languages, just specifying the language in the prompt.
For example:
"Analyze the following Python code..."
"Analyze the following C++ code..."
And so on.
Then, I need to map file extensions to languages, so I know what to put in the prompt.
I can create a dictionary mapping extensions to language names.
For example:
EXT_TO_LANG = {
'.py': 'Python',
'.cpp': 'C++',
'.java': 'Java',
'.js': 'JavaScript',
etc.
}
Then, for each file, I can determine the language and construct the prompt accordingly.
Now, about building the graph. Let's say I have this information for each file. How do I connect them across files?
For example, if file A imports file B and calls a function from file B, I need to link the calling function in file A to the called function in file B.
To do this, I need to keep track of where each function is defined.
So, perhaps I can maintain a global dictionary mapping function names to their file and description.
Wait, but function names might not be unique across files. In many languages, functions can have the same name in different modules.
So, I need a way to uniquely identify functions.
One way is to use the fully qualified name, including the module or namespace.
For example, in Python, it could be module_name.function_name.
In C++, it could be namespace::class::function.
But extracting the fully qualified name might be tricky.
Alternatively, I can assign a unique identifier to each function, like file_path:function_name.
Then, when the LLM identifies a call, I can ask it to specify the module or file where the called function is defined.
Wait, but the LLM might not always know that, especially if the call is to a function in another file.
However, if I provide the LLM with the entire codebase or at least the relevant parts, it might be able to infer the connections.
But that could be impractical for large codebases.
Alternatively, I can first analyze each file individually, then look for connections based on imports.
For example, if file A imports module B, then any function call in file A that matches a function name in module B can be linked.
But this might not be precise, as there could be name collisions.
Another idea is to have the LLM analyze the entire codebase at once, but that might exceed the context limits of the LLM.
So, perhaps a better approach is to analyze each file, extract the defined functions and the calls made, then later resolve the calls by matching them to the defined functions across the codebase.
For instance, for each call identified in a file, I can record it as a potential edge, and then try to find a matching function definition in the codebase.
To handle name collisions, I can use heuristics, like checking if the called function is defined in an imported module.
This might require parsing the import statements.
Wait, but since I'm using the LLM, maybe I can ask it to specify which module the called function belongs to.
For example, in the prompt, I can say:
"For each function call, specify the module or file where the called function is defined, if possible."
Then, the LLM might be able to provide that information based on the import statements and the code context.
For instance, in Python, if there's an import like "from module import func", then a call to "func()" likely refers to that imported function.
Similarly, in C++, if there's an include directive and a call to a function, the LLM might infer which header it comes from.
This could work, but it might not be perfect.
Alternatively, I can combine AI analysis with traditional parsing for import statements.
For example, use regular expressions or simple parsing to extract import statements, then use that information to resolve function calls.
This hybrid approach might be more accurate.
Let me think about that.
So, for each file, I can first extract the import statements using traditional methods, then use the LLM to analyze the code and identify functions and calls, and then use the import information to resolve the calls.
For example, in Python, I can parse lines starting with "import" or "from ... import" to get the imported modules and functions.
Then, when the LLM identifies a call to "func()", I can check if "func" is imported from another module, and if so, link it to that module's function.
Similarly, for C++, I can parse "#include" directives to know which headers are included, and perhaps map function calls to those headers.
This seems promising.
So, the workflow would be:
Traverse the directory to find all code files.

For each file, determine its language based on extension.

Extract import statements using language-specific parsers or regex.

Feed the code to the LLM with a prompt to analyze functions, inputs, outputs, and calls.

Parse the LLM's response to get functions and calls.

For each call, use the import information to resolve which function it refers to.

Build the graph accordingly.

Wait, but to make it more accurate, perhaps I can provide the LLM with the list of imported functions or modules in the prompt.
For example:
"Here is a Python code file that imports the following modules: [list of modules]. Analyze the code and identify functions, their descriptions, inputs, outputs, and any calls to other functions, specifying if the called function is from an imported module."
Then, the LLM can say something like: "Calls: func() from module X"
This way, I can directly link the call to the specific function in the imported module.
That sounds better.
So, I'll need to extract the import statements first, then include that information in the prompt to the LLM.
Now, how do I extract import statements?
For Python, it's relatively straightforward: look for lines starting with "import" or "from ... import".
For other languages, it might be different.
For example, in C++, it's "#include <header>" or "#include "header"", but that doesn't directly tell me which functions are imported.
In C++, functions are declared in headers, so I might need to analyze the headers as well to know which functions are available.
That could be complicated.
Similarly, in Java, it's "import package.Class;", which imports classes, not individual functions.
So, for languages like Java or C++, it might be harder to map function calls to specific imports.
Perhaps for those languages, I can still ask the LLM to identify calls and try to infer the relationships based on the code context.
Alternatively, I can focus on intra-file calls first, and for inter-file calls, use a simpler heuristic, like matching function names across files.
But that might lead to inaccuracies.
Another idea is to build a symbol table or a database of all defined functions across the codebase, then for each call, find the matching definition.
For languages with namespaces or modules, I can include that in the symbol name.
For example, in Python, if a function is defined in module A, its symbol could be "A.func".
Then, when analyzing another file that imports A and calls A.func(), I can link it directly.
Similarly, in C++, if a function is in a namespace, I can use "namespace::func".
But extracting the fully qualified name might require parsing the code more carefully.
Wait, since I'm using the LLM, perhaps I can ask it to provide the fully qualified name of each function definition and each call.
For example, in the prompt, I can say:
"For each function definition, provide its fully qualified name, including module or namespace.
For each function call, provide the fully qualified name of the called function, if possible."
Then, the LLM might be able to provide that information based on the code.
For instance, in Python, if the file is module.py and it defines func(), the fully qualified name is module.func.
If another file imports module and calls module.func(), the LLM can identify it as such.
Similarly, in C++, if a function is defined in namespace N, it's N::func.
This could work, but it relies on the LLM's ability to understand and provide fully qualified names.
Given that LLMs are trained on code, they might be able to do this reasonably well.
So, let's assume that the LLM can provide fully qualified names for functions and calls.
Then, I can use those to build the graph.
For example, each node in the graph can be labeled with the fully qualified name, and edges can connect callers to callees based on those names.
This way, even if there are name collisions, the fully qualified names should be unique.
Moreover, for dependencies, I can include edges between modules or files based on import statements.
For instance, if file A imports module B, I can have an edge from A to B indicating the dependency.
Then, the diagram can show both the call graph and the module dependency graph.
Perhaps I can generate two separate diagrams: one for the call graph and one for the dependency graph.
Or, I can combine them in some way.
But for starters, let's focus on the call graph.
So, to summarize the approach:
Traverse the directory to find all code files.

For each file, determine its language.

Extract import statements to know which modules or headers are imported.

Feed the code to the LLM with a prompt that includes the language, the imported modules, and asks for:
List of functions defined, with fully qualified names, descriptions, inputs, outputs.

List of function calls, with fully qualified names of the called functions.

Parse the LLM's response to get this information.

Build a graph where nodes are functions (with their descriptions), and edges are calls.

Generate a diagram using Graphviz.

Additionally, to make it more detailed, I can include information about classes, if applicable, or other code structures.
But for now, let's keep it to functions.
Also, for the workflow diagram, if the user wants to see execution paths, that might require more in-depth analysis, like control flow graphs.
However, generating a full control flow graph might be too complex, especially with an LLM.
Perhaps I can ask the LLM to identify the main execution paths or key control structures, but that could be vague.
Alternatively, I can stick with the call graph, which is already quite useful for understanding how different parts of the code interact.
Moreover, the user mentioned "major execution code paths," so perhaps highlighting the main functions or entry points could be sufficient.
For example, in many programs, there is a main function or entry point, and from there, the call graph can show the flow.
So, in the diagram, I can highlight or emphasize the entry points.
To identify entry points, I can look for functions like "main" in C/C++, or functions decorated with @app
.route in Flask, etc.
But again, this might be language-specific.
Alternatively, I can ask the LLM to identify potential entry points in the code.
For instance, in the prompt, I can add: "Identify any potential entry points or main functions in the code."
Then, the LLM can provide that information, and I can highlight those nodes in the diagram.
This way, the diagram can show the overall structure with emphasis on where the execution starts.
Furthermore, to make the diagram more informative, I can include the function descriptions in the node labels, so that users can see what each function does.
For example, each node can be labeled as "module.func: description".
This provides both the name and the purpose.
Now, about the implementation.
I need to use an LLM API, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, to analyze the code.
I'll need to send the code along with the prompt and parse the response.
Since code files can be large, I might need to handle cases where the code exceeds the token limit of the LLM.
In such cases, I can split the code into smaller chunks or summarize parts of it.
But for simplicity, let's assume that the code files are small enough to fit within the token limit.
If not, I can implement chunking or select key parts of the code to analyze.
Also, to make the tool more efficient, I can cache the analysis results for each file, so that if the file hasn't changed, I don't need to re-analyze it.
But that's an optimization for later.
Another consideration is handling binary files or non-code files.
Since the user wants to analyze code projects, I should skip non-code files, like images or data files.
I can define a list of code file extensions to include, such as .py, .cpp, .java, .js, etc.
Files with other extensions can be ignored.
Additionally, I might want to exclude certain directories, like .git or node_modules, to avoid analyzing unnecessary files.
I can add a list of directories to skip.
Now, let's think about the output.
The user wants a diagram, so I'll use Graphviz to generate a DOT file and then render it as an image, say PNG or SVG.
Graphviz can handle large graphs, but for very large codebases, the diagram might become too cluttered.
In such cases, I can provide options to filter the graph, like showing only certain modules or functions.
But for now, let's generate the full graph.
Also, I can provide the DOT file so that users can manipulate it if needed.
Moreover, since the analysis might take time, I should provide progress updates, like printing which file is being analyzed.
Now, to make this more concrete, let's sketch some code.
First, I'll need to install the necessary libraries: openai, graphviz, and perhaps pathlib for handling paths.
Wait, actually, for OpenAI, I can use the official openai Python package.
So, pip install openai graphviz.
Then, in the code, I'll need to set up the OpenAI API key.
I can use an environment variable for that.
Next, I'll write a function to traverse the directory and find code files.
I can use os.walk for that.
For each code file, I'll determine the language based on the extension.
Then, I'll extract the import statements.
For simplicity, let's focus on Python first.
For Python, I can use regular expressions to find import statements.
For example:
import re
import_pattern = re.compile(r'^\s*(import|from)\s+\w+', re.MULTILINE)
Then, find all matches in the code.
But actually, to get the list of imported modules, I can parse the import statements more carefully.
For instance, for "import module", the module is "module".
For "from module import func", the module is "module".
So, I can collect the list of imported modules.
Then, in the prompt, I can say: "The following modules are imported: [list]"
Similarly, for other languages, I can define language-specific ways to extract imports.
But to keep it general, perhaps I can have a dictionary of regex patterns for each language.
For example:
IMPORT_PATTERNS = {
'Python': r'^\s*(import|from)\s+\w+',
'C++': r'^\s*#include\s+["<]\w+[">]',
etc.
}
Then, for each language, use the corresponding pattern to find import lines.
Then, extract the module names from those lines.
For Python, it's the word after "import" or "from".
For C++, it's the header name inside the quotes or angle brackets.
And so on.
Once I have the list of imported modules, I can include that in the prompt.
Then, send the prompt to the LLM and get the response.
Parse the response to extract functions and calls.
For parsing, I can look for sections like "FUNCTIONS:" and "CALLS:", assuming the LLM formats the response as requested.
Then, for each function, extract its name, description, inputs, outputs.
For calls, extract the caller and callee.
Wait, actually, in the prompt, I should ask for the list of functions with their details, and for each function, the list of calls it makes.
So, the response might be structured like:
FUNCTIONS:
fully_qualified_name1:
Description: ...
Inputs: ...
Outputs: ...
Calls: [list of called functions]
fully_qualified_name2:
...
Then, I can parse this structure.
To parse it, I can split the response into sections, then use regular expressions or string manipulation to extract the details.
Once I have this information for all files, I can build the graph.
For each function, add a node with its name and description.
For each call, add an edge from the caller to the callee.
Finally, generate the DOT file and render it.
Additionally, to make the diagram more readable, I can group functions by their modules or files, using Graphviz subgraphs or clusters.
For example, all functions from the same file can be in a cluster labeled with the file name.
This way, the diagram shows the modular structure.
To do that in Graphviz, I can use subgraphs.
For instance:
subgraph cluster_file1 {
label = "file1.py";
node1 [label="func1: description"];
node2 [label="func2: description"];
}
Then, edges between nodes.
Yes, that can help organize the graph.
So, in the code, I can keep track of which functions belong to which files, and create subgraphs accordingly.
Also, for dependencies between files, I can add edges between the clusters if one file imports another.
But that might be optional.
For now, let's focus on the function call graph with clusters for files.
Moreover, to highlight entry points, I can ask the LLM to identify potential entry points, and then use a different shape or color for those nodes.
For example, in the prompt, add: "Identify any potential entry points or main functions."
Then, in the response, look for a section like "ENTRY_POINTS: [list]"
Then, when adding nodes, if a function is an entry point, set its shape to, say, doublecircle or use a different color.
This way, the diagram shows where the execution might start.
Finally, to make the tool more user-friendly, I can add command-line arguments to specify the directory, output file, etc.
For example, using argparse.
But for the initial version, a simple script that prompts for the directory is fine.
Now, let's consider the limitations.
First, the accuracy depends on the LLM's ability to understand the code correctly.
There might be cases where the LLM misidentifies functions or calls, especially in complex or obfuscated code.
To mitigate this, I can include a self-checking step, as mentioned in the previous message.
For example, after generating the graph, I can ask the LLM to review it for consistency or errors.
But that might be overkill for now.
Alternatively, I can provide a way for users to manually correct the graph if needed, but that's beyond the scope.
Another limitation is the cost and time of using the LLM API, especially for large codebases.
Each file analysis requires an API call, which can be expensive and slow.
To address this, I can implement caching: store the analysis results in a file, and only re-analyze files that have changed.
For example, use a hash of the file content to check if it's changed since last analysis.
This way, for repeated runs on the same codebase, it's faster.
But for the first run, it still takes time.
Also, I need to handle rate limits of the API.
I can add delays or retries if needed.
Furthermore, for very large files, I might need to split the code or summarize it.
But let's assume the files are manageable.
Another consideration is handling generated code or third-party libraries.
The user might not want to analyze external libraries, only their own code.
So, I can add an option to exclude certain directories, like virtual environments or node_modules.
For example, skip directories named "venv", ".env", "node_modules", etc.
I can hardcode a list of directories to skip.
Now, to wrap it up, let's outline the final solution.
Final Solution
To address the user's requirement, we will build an AI-powered application that analyzes a code project's directory, understands the code in detail, and generates a detailed diagram showing the code's structure, dependencies, and execution paths. This solution leverages AI agents (specifically, Large Language Models) to make it adaptable to any programming language, both current and future.
Approach
Directory Traversal: Recursively explore the directory to find all code files based on their extensions.

Language Detection: Determine the programming language of each file using its extension.

Import Extraction: Use regular expressions to extract import statements or include directives from the code, providing context for dependencies.

AI Analysis: Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to analyze each code file, extracting:
Fully qualified names of functions or methods.

Descriptions of what each function does.

Inputs and outputs for each function.

Calls made to other functions, including those from imported modules.

Potential entry points (e.g., main functions).

Graph Construction: Build a graph where:
Nodes represent functions with their descriptions.

Edges represent function calls.

Clusters group functions by their respective files.

Diagram Generation: Use Graphviz to generate a visual diagram (e.g., PNG) of the graph, highlighting entry points and organizing functions by file.

This approach ensures the tool is language-agnostic, adaptable, and capable of providing deep insights into any codebase.

Explanation
Directory Traversal: The traverse_directory function recursively finds all code files based on their extensions while skipping irrelevant directories like venv or node_modules.

Language Detection: The programming language is determined from the file extension using a predefined mapping.

Import Extraction: Regular expressions are used to extract import statements or include directives, providing context for the AI analysis.

AI Analysis: Each code file is analyzed using an LLM (e.g., GPT-4), which extracts function definitions, descriptions, inputs, outputs, calls, and potential entry points.

Graph Construction: A Graphviz graph is built where:
Functions are nodes, grouped by their respective files using clusters.

Edges represent function calls.

Entry points are highlighted with a distinct shape (e.g., doublecircle).

Diagram Generation: The graph is rendered as a PNG file, providing a visual representation of the code's structure and execution paths.

This solution ensures the application is flexible, language-agnostic, and capable of providing detailed insights into any codebase, making it ideal for helping developers understand and navigate complex projects efficiently.
